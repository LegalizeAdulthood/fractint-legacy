The following describes compiling Fractint from the command line
using make files, or from the IDE using project files. These procedures
work with Borland 3.1.

The command line procedures assume that all the files are in a 
subdirectory of your BORLANDC directory, at the same level as INCLUDE 
and LIB. Delete the supplied .obj files first; you will need TASM to 
complete the compile.

Command Line Compile
====================

Just type BCAUTO.

The following files are supplied in connection with the command line compile:

BCAUTO.BAT
BCLINKF.BAT
BCMAKALL.BAT
BCFRACT.CFG
BCFRACT2.CFG
BCFRACT.LNK
BCHC.LNK
BCFRACT.MAK
BCFRACT.BAT


IDE Compile
===========

   1. From the IDE, open hc.prj and compile it.
   2. Run hc.exe from the IDE (the command line argument "/c" is preselected).
   3. Open fractint.prj and compile it.
   4. Exit the IDE, and run hc.exe with the switch /a (this step is
        optional).

Note - The .prj files assume that include and library files are in the default
c:\borlandc directories created upon installation of BC++ 3.1. If you have a
different configuration, you may need to edit the .prj files accordingly.
