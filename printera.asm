;  This file contains various lookup tables used by PJGIF.  Patterns contains
;  unsigned values representing each of the 330 HP PaintJet colors.  Each color
;  at 90 DPI is composed of four dots in 8 colors.  Each hex digit of these
;  unsigned values represents one of the four dots.  Although the PaintJet will
;  produce these patterns automatically in 90 DPI mode, it is much faster to do
;  it in software with the PaintJet in 8-color 180 DPI mode.
